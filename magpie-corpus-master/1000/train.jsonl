It is the terms for the conversion of the convertible redeemable preference shares that provide the mechanism whereby the interests of the management vary according to the company's performance. These shares are held by the investors, and on the triggering of the ratchet — the achievement of certain projections or market capitalisation on a flotation, for example — all or some of the convertible redeemable preference shares will be redeemed ; but if the results fall short of what is expected then they will be converted into ordinary shares and as a result increase the investor's share of the equity at the expense of the proportion held by management. The ratchet is invariably geared to the rate of return which the investors expect to receive on their equity and that usually depends on the expected market capitalisation of the company. When acting for management, it is important to ensure that the ratchet is not entirely geared to the vagaries of the stock market in the event of a flotation, but also reflects the profitability of the company.

Let us for the time being not take a stand on this issue but address ourselves to the whole phenomenon in its strong sense. Whether a system with finitely many basic signals is a system of communication in the strong sense — that is, a linguistic system — depends on whether the characteristic behaviour within which and against which it is interpreted is complex enough to sustain attributions of higher-order beliefs and intentions to the creatures concerned. If one has to resort to such an intentional framework in order to make sense of the behaviour, in order to explain what the creatures are doing and why, and has so to resort after exhausting all possibilities of more austere, less anthropomorphic frameworks of explanation, then one is on the route to linguistic meanings.

Through the totality, itself a kind of rational self writ large, the individual takes on meaning ; the present is sacrificed to a future which will bring forth an ultimate, objective meaning when the totality of history is realized. The objection therefore to totalization is not founded on any simple analogy with totalitarianism — though neither can this be excluded — but rather on the implicit violence of ontology itself, in which the same constitutes itself through a form of negativity in relation to the other, producing all knowledge by appropriating and sublating the other within itself.

From this grew the notion that the pope had the power not simply to explain and interpret the law, but to make it, whether by word of mouth in councils or by letter.

Such a tax is often claimed to encourage saving but the argument can cut both ways. The taxing of consumption does make current saving more attractive.

As the champion of the unskilled workers of Ireland, patriot and prophet of revolutionary socialism, Larkin claimed both independence of and support from all and sundry in the trade union world. In March 1913, profiting from Wilson's 1911 victory, Larking embarked on a fifteen week dispute with the City of Dublin Steamship Packet Company, bringing this to a successful conclusion and becoming in his biographer's words, \" the virtual dictator of the port of Dublin \", and the possessor of a profitable joint agreement with the shipowners arrived at on 26 May which included a no-strike clause.

But as with physical wounds, it can sometimes run into complications caused by careless handling or the existence of unfavourable external or internal conditions which may delay recovery ; so the main concern of those caring for the bereaved should be to try to create the best possible conditions in which healing can take place, in which they feel loved and safe, and are permitted to take their time to absorb the fact of their loss and come to terms with it.

Given the awareness that not all' Asians' were middle class and/or immune to racism within the education system, however, how could the apparently better' Asian'educational performance be understood? In the final analysis, the Swann Report not only put aside what it had already acknowledged about the relatively poor performance of students of Bangladesh I origin, but ignored evidence that students of Mirpuri Pakistani origin were also under performing, while students of East African Asian origin seemed to be achieving exceptionally well. Social class and rural-urban contrasts, and different relations with British colonial states and education systems, are very likely to be involved as causal influences here, and Swann could well have commissioned research to explore some of the underlying issues. Instead, despite its disavowals and qualifications the Report slid into the trap of singling out' Asian' culture and especially its main bearer, ' the Asian family', to explain the contrast with' West Indians'.

But if this reading of the Reeve's character, and of the relationship between teller and tale, were true, it would leave the Reeve almost uniquely condemned amongst the Canterbury pilgrims. He would not, of course, be alone in being exposed in the General Prologue and enhancing the adverse view of himself by his own Prologue — consider, for instance, the Pardoner — but he would be alone in then telling a tale which clinches the destruction of any claim to a good character he might have ; a tale without any redeeming features, which the tales of even the worst of the corrupt clerics, the Friar and the Pardoner, have. After reminding ourselves, once more, that the General Prologue portrait of the Reeve contains its ambiguities — possibly sinister ones — we can start our examination of the portrayal of the Reeve with his Prologue.

Nor did it seem apparent to all that the war fought at sea, the damage which might be inflicted upon enemy vessels and morale, and the consequences which victory at sea could have for those who lived in areas close to coasts, were all part of a wider war which could not be restricted to the fighting on land.

It had initially been planned for next week. The congress — taking place in an atmosphere of extreme vindictiveness among the SED rank and file following the corruption revelations — will determine the future of the Communist Party. Representatives are due to elect a completely new central committee and politburo, but the party newspaper, Neues Deutschland, suggested yesterday that such ‘ Stalinist institutions’ would perhaps no longer be required if the SED was transformed into a ‘ truly democratic party’. The emergency SED leadership pledged that the congress would break with the ‘ Stalinist system’. ", "LBL": "i"}
