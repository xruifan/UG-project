{"confidence": 1.0, "context": "We conclude that the obtained variations in the base modification pattern in the different tRNA variants are due to changes in the normal 3D-structure of tRNA Asp caused by the introduced mutations.

Other bases in the variable loop of tRNA Asp are also involved in tertiary interactions, such as A46 hydrogen bonded to G22 in the D-stem and U48 hydrogen bonded to A15 in the D-loop of the tRNA (19) . As a consequence, insertion of an extra base between A46 and U48 in tRNA Asp (mutants a209, a210, a214 and a215)  affects the structure of the tRNA (28) , either by changing the distance between the interacting bases or by forming new interactions. Our results demonstrate the importance of an intact tRNA-structure for its recognition by the tRNA modifying enzymes tRNA (m 1 G37)  methyltransferase, Q34insertase, tRNA(Ψ40)  -pseudouridylate synthase and tRNA (m 2 G26/m 2 2G26)  methyltransferase(s) .

The Department of Health has cultivated the myth for some years that section 118 of the Medicines Act is the only reason why it is prevented from explaining the decisions of the licensing authority in general or the recommendations of the Committee on Safety of Medicines, based on doctors' reports of adverse reactions, in particular. The reports, made by doctors on yellow cards, is data that the committee owns and as such can be disclosed by them as they see fit. Papers based on such data have appeared in the medical literature on many occasions since the inception of the yellow card scheme in 1964.
