When the Christian Brethren movement and the Catholic Apostolic Church emerged in Britain in the 1830s and the Millerites in New England waited for the return of Christ in the 1840s, adventism had already taken firm root in evangelicalism (where it has remained ever since) .

When a politician assisted a freeholder with a gift of a patronage appointment, he would almost always give it in the guise of an act of friendship, and it was the friendly relationship which was the truly significant factor. The intent of the politician was of course to create a feeling of obligation, which he undoubtedly hoped would stand him in good stead at the next election, but such feelings were all the stronger because the shrewd political manager never breathed a word about a bargain or the anticipated political return. Acts of seemingly disinterested friendship, reinforced by regular social contacts, were in fact the only sound approach to building a powerful county interest. On the other hand, even if the politician demonstrated his ability to provide a great deal of patronage, if he did not follow it up with effective social contact, he would be laying a poor foundation for a political interest, and the gratitude of the freeholders under those circumstances could be short-lived.

The population growth study took into account both accessibility and the impact of planning policies, including constraints such as green belts. The GIS gave rapid and easy access to the data in a number of different ways, it provided analytical tools for the production of statistical tables, and it allowed the output of maps and specific factors, such as the overlay of the road network onto the green belt layer, showing areas of high and low accessibility, thus permitting the evaluation of population growth potential relative to accessibility and planning constraints. The second study used the transport layer of the database to identify the locations of 900 stations on the British Railways network.

Let us for the time being not take a stand on this issue but address ourselves to the whole phenomenon in its strong sense.

Each experience of imprisonment, for even the most hardened recidivist, is, until the routine is established which numbs the mind, a wrenching of the spirit. ", "LBL": "i"}

Six years of intense agitation followed, until Leopold's death finally opened the way for reforms in the Belgian Congo, and the opening of the colony to free trade. Throughout this agitation Morel's appeal to the presumed interests of Liverpool merchants was quite open and unashamed : the liberation of Africans enslaved by Leopold and his monopolistic ring of financiers, and the interests of genuine traders in free trade, went hand in hand. Just as in 1876 — Morel frequently compared his efforts with the outburst against the Bulgarian atrocities — the campaigners were outraged by Foreign Office insistence that wider considerations of the balance of power should be taken into account when deciding how far to push their humanitarian crusade. Impatient with the intricacies — and amorality — of international diplomacy, Morel demanded unilateral action by the British Navy. ", "LBL": "i"}

Only if productivity increases is it possible in the long-run for both groups to be successful.

The occupational therapist's role usually includes advising on suitable types of clothing for the patient, partly to make dressing simple and practical, and also so that the clothing chosen is helpful in the process through which the patient relearns to dress himself. The community occupational therapist also assesses whether the patient has any perceptual problems, such as an inability to recognize left and right, or total lack of awareness of the affected side of his body. These difficulties have to be explained to the carer, as they can be hard to understand. The occupational therapist plans suitable activities through which the carer can help the patient to overcome these perceptual problems. ", "LBL": "l"}

British governments had no strength to resist these arguments, and as a consequence the North Sea Oil installations, working literally at break-neck speed unfettered by safety regulations comparable to those operating on-shore, had a fatality rate eleven times greater than the construction industry, nine times higher than mining, and six times greater than quarrying. Carson concludes, after carefully researching the individual incidents which constituted this high rate of fatality (as well as those involving serious injuries)  that the majority could have been avoided if the ‘ political economy of speed’ had not been allowed to supersede the ‘ political economy of employees lives and limbs’. With the internationalization of capital and the concentration of power in the hands of fewer and fewer transnational corporations, national law violation may well become old fashioned.

Europeans feared being overwhelmed by Cold War terrors and some hoped that, through greater unity, they could form a ‘ third force’ to match America and Russia. In September 1947 Britain's foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, and France's premier, Paul Ramadier, talked of uniting their colonial empires together, and socialist politicians including British premier Clement Attlee hoped to give the third force an ideological dimension : against American capitalism and Soviet communism, Europe would stand as the champion of democratic socialism, combining liberal political rights with radical social reform.

This explains, for example, how, faced with the sentence \" Babar the King of the elephants went to a restaurant \" (p. 52) , we project our experience of real human beings onto the fictional character, and infer that the reason for Babar's action must be the aim to satisfy his desire for food. By the same token, however, says Ryan, one would have to conclude that the world of \" Jabberwocky \" contains computers, and that Little Red Riding Hood could, if so inclined, peruse the writings of Aquinas. The provisos and conditions that Ryan adds to the Principle in order to rule out such possibilities are as clumsy and ad hoc as the questions that they aim to answer, at least to the non-logician. Apart from the fact that a possible-worlds approach inevitably runs into problems if it insists on the logical completeness of fictional universes, it seems to me that what is a valid issue in logic does not necessarily have to be a valid issue in poetics and narratology.

The welfare state was described by its intellectual architect, Lord Beveridge, as a structure built to protect the individual “ from the cradle to the grave. ” This model came to dominate every West European country, with local traditions and local politics dictating the diversity of its application.

The original design included two control communities, one with experience of a local nuclear power station (Hinckley Point) , and one with no such experience or prospect of a similar development. However, this design had to be reinterpreted in the light of the CEGB's decision to build a further power station at Hinckley Point rather than at he five sites originally named. A combination of interview and questionnaire studies and a content analysis of media coverage was employed, with the purpose of elucidating the reasons for people's preferences for different energy options, their perceptions of the risks involved, and of the viability of alternative energy sources.

The accelerating property boom is likely, before long, to create a new downtown in the area around Potsdamer Platz and Leipziger Platz — once Berlin's busiest traffic junction and in recent decades its ugliest wound, a grey no man's land between two barrier walls. A year ago, Daimler-Benz snapped up 62,000 square metres of land there for only Dm93 million. ", "LBL": "i"}

A bowler who strays wide of the off or leg stumps gives the batsman' width' and enables him to glance, cut, and deflect, opening up scoring opportunities in a 360 degree circle around the bat. By pitching the ball up and bowling in the channel he makes his opponent hit back along the line of the approaching delivery and play the ball into the' V' — the arc of the field which lies between extra cover on the off side and a straightish mid-wicket on the leg side. If the batsman seeks to score behind the wicket off a full length ball which is in the channel, he must hit' across the line of the delivery, ' minimise his chances of making contact and increase the risk of his being bowled or dismissed lbw. The beauty about making the batsman hit into the V is that the bowler can pack his fielders in that area of the field and make it extremely difficult for the batsman to score more than a single.

Moreover, we do not wish to give the impression that the cello and bass always work in double harness : on the contrary, they can be used independently to a quite large extent, though discretion and careful thought are very necessary in this matter, since the basses when used alone tend to sound rather dry, and if their part lies low and is far removed in pitch from the rest of the harmony it is too indeterminate in pitch to give satisfactory support unless it consists of a sustained or better (since the bow is short)  a reiterated pedal note.

From Pamplona the army and the Carlist Requeté advanced northwards and by September, with the help of Italian bombers, had seized Irún and San Sebastián, thereby cutting off the rest of the Basque country and the north coast from the French border. Other detachments headed south from northern, rebel-held cities in an advance on Madrid, only to find themselves humiliatingly held by urban militia groups in the Guadarrama mountains north of the city. This last disappointment bestowed proportionately greater importance upon developments in the southern sector. While military, Falangist and Carlist units, fanning out from rebel-held Seville, Cádiz, Córdoba and Granada, set about conquering the rest of Andalusia, Franco's Army of Africa and its accompanying Moorish troops pushed rapidly northwards from their southern beach-head into Extremadura and towards Madrid.

{"TEXT1": "After a brief period during which a registered trade union was a corporate body under the Act of 1971, the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 restored the immunity, though liability was imposed (where there was no trade dispute)  for certain torts causing personal injury or breaches of duty connected with the union's property. It remains the law that a trade union is not, and is not to be treated as if it were, a body corporate, but a much wider measure of tort liability is now imposed by the Employment Act 1982. The central difficulty is that of attributing responsibility to the ‘ centre’ in such a ‘ devolved’organisation as the typical trade union, bearing in mind the likelihood that ‘ unofficial action’will be taken at individual plant level without prior consultation with the union's central organs. The fundamental proposition of the 1982 Act is that the immunity of trade unions in tort is totally abolished, though the union enjoys the same defences as an individual where action is taken in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute. However, the range of the union's responsibility for the acts of its officers and members differs according to the nature of the claim which is brought against it. ", "LBL": "i"}

Indeed, the author of Le débat des hérauts d'armes could state that the French nobility did not regard fighting at sea as being a noble activity : it is perhaps for this reason that naval warfare did not feature in the chronicles in the way that war on land did. Nor did it seem apparent to all that the war fought at sea, the damage which might be inflicted upon enemy vessels and morale, and the consequences which victory at sea could have for those who lived in areas close to coasts, were all part of a wider war which could not be restricted to the fighting on land.

In clay and heavy soils the risk is increased that the hole will then hold water for considerable periods, with the plant and stake actually standing in water. If it freezes, a collar of ice is then so much the worse, so it is a wise precaution to go round your roses after windy conditions and tread firm and close out any ‘ funnels’— but of course the danger to taller bushes can be much reduced by shortening sail.

His successful infiltration of the journal Bier between 1930 and 1931, and his unsuccessful attempt in 1931 to influence the editorial policy of Barbusse's journal, Monde, were striking examples of Nizan's attempt to develop a sectarian communist cultural policy within the sphere of bourgeois publishing houses. This effort on Nizan's part to promote orthodox sectarian communist party ideology within a bourgeois context found no greater expression than during the year he spent in Bourg-en-Bresse, when he was at one and the same time philosophy teacher at the Lycee Lalande and communist party candidate at the general election of 1932. Arguably, this public proclamation of secretarian communist beliefs during the election campaign, alerting as it did the bourgeois authorities to the subversive political activities of this \" Red Messiah \", and resulting in Nizan's transfer to Auch, precipitated his decision to become a fully integrated member of the PCF.

The fundamental point in the appeal, however, does not depend on that issue. The court has made a direction to the local authority that the guardian ad litem be allowed to have continuing involvement with a view to making an application in due course if thought appropriate. There is nothing in the Children Act 1989 which provides for the court to tack any direction on to a care order and I have to say that, in my judgment, the addition of a direction of any sort to a care order is a fetter on the local authority plans, authority and responsibility. Under section 22(3)  of the Children Act 1989 the local authority has the duty ‘ to safeguard and promote the welfare’ of children in care and, in my judgment, responsibility for the care of the child is firmly with the local authority once a care order is made.

PRINCETON – The small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan is known internationally for two things : high visa fees, which reduce the influx of tourists, and its policy of promoting “ gross national happiness ” instead of economic growth. The two are related : more tourists might boost the economy, but they would damage Bhutan ’s environment and culture, and so reduce happiness in the long run. When I first heard of Bhutan ’s goal of maximizing its people ’s happiness, I wondered if it really meant anything in practice, or was just another political slogan. Last month, when I was in the capital, Thimphu, to speak at a conference on “ Economic ~ Development and Happiness, ” organized by Prime ~ Minister Jigme Y.

{"TEXT1": "Until the 1640s the colonies had taken it for granted that they would trade only with England, partly because Charles's government gave orders that they should, partly because the hostile Spanish colonies offered them no real alternative. The success of the Dutch in the West Indian sugar trade in the 1640s showed that this natural monopoly of the colonies' trade would not last any longer, so English shipbuilders were gratified to find that the Navigation Act would limit the colonial trade to English ships. The direct effect was to cut sharply into the Dutch carrying trade, by shutting re-exports from Dutch ports out of England (which compensated English colonies to some extent for losing their Dutch connections)  and by forbidding the export of colonial products in Dutch ships. The legislation was resented bitterly enough by the Netherlands to lead to a war in which the English Republic was able to assert itself against the Dutch Republic. But when the great general of the Civil War, Oliver Cromwell, lost his temper with the Rump Parliament for trying to monopolize power, and made himself supreme instead, he regretted this war between Protestant countries and set out to make peace between them as soon as possible.

Its corollary, or ‘ visage’, is the concept of totality, which, as Levinas observes, has dominated Western philosophy in its long history of desire for Unity and the One. Through the totality, itself a kind of rational self writ large, the individual takes on meaning ; the present is sacrificed to a future which will bring forth an ultimate, objective meaning when the totality of history is realized. The objection therefore to totalization is not founded on any simple analogy with totalitarianism — though neither can this be excluded — but rather on the implicit violence of ontology itself, in which the same constitutes itself through a form of negativity in relation to the other, producing all knowledge by appropriating and sublating the other within itself. As Levinas puts it, ‘ the idea of truth as a grasp on things must necessarily have a non-metaphorical sense somewhere’. ", "LBL": "i"}

Switzerland's parliamentarians, who until then had favoured continuing restrictions on foreigners, hastily changed their minds. That year Nestlé — which accounts for a tenth of the Swiss stockmarket — opened its register to overseas investors, and a number of other companies have followed suit. A new law, expected to be in force by 1993, would allow companies to restrict individual shareholdings to a given percentage, but would bar non-registration of shareholdings unless the company otherwise could not continue normal operations. That is a reference to the ‘ Lex Friedrich’ on foreign landholding. ", "LBL": "i"}
