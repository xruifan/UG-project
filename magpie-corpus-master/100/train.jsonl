The congress — taking place in an atmosphere of extreme vindictiveness among the SED rank and file following the corruption revelations — will determine the future of the Communist Party. Representatives are due to elect a completely new central committee and politburo, but the party newspaper, Neues Deutschland, suggested yesterday that such ‘ Stalinist institutions’ would perhaps no longer be required if the SED was transformed into a ‘ truly democratic party’. The emergency SED leadership pledged that the congress would break with the ‘ Stalinist system’. ", "LBL": "i"}

Young people's needs for information, understanding, and entertainment are not only met by books but also by television programmes, by cinema films, and by recorded sound. If we are concerned with obtaining meaning from symbols and images, it follows that we should be concerned with this wide range of media.

Many Koi bought by BKKS customers from London and Norwich have won prizes at shows, and the varieties include the ‘ Big Three’ plus metallics, Gin-rin and Kawarimono. Quite apart from the cost factor, this growing-on of fish means that all the Japanese Koi have overcome the teething problems you associate with new imports. ", "LBL": "i"}

Of course, record companies are always going to want you to have a hit, but as far as what we do, they just have to look at our albums and try to pick out something they can exploit that way, after the event, as compared to trying to make us sit down and write a hit.
