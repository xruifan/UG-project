{"TEXT1": "Three IRA men were killed in hail of bullets, inquest told UNDERCOVER soldiers fired more than 200 rounds at a hijacked car during a shoot-out in which three Irish Republican Army men died, an inquest at Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, heard yesterday. No warning had been given by the soldiers because they believed their comrades' lives were in danger and they were under fire from the hijacked car, the hearing was told. The inquest is into the deaths of brothers Michael Gerard Hart, 29, and Martin Joseph Hart, 23, and their brother-in-law, Brian Mullin, 26, all from the Sixmilecross area of Co Tyrone.

{"TEXT1": "Rather surprisingly, perhaps, this petition was not granted in full. Henry was allowed to assume the title of Earl of Lancaster and to receive a great part of the Lancaster inheritance, but the Lacy earldom of Lincoln, which Earl Thomas had held in right of his wife, was not fully recovered until 1348. The Earl of Hereford's son was granted livery of his father's inheritance, the Clifford family was restored, and the Mowbray inheritance was placed in wardship with the Countess of Warenne until John Mowbray's heir came of age. In acquisitiveness and greed there was little to choose between the victors and the vanquished in the political struggles of the 1320s. Isabella recovered her lands, which were augmented by additional grants worth about £ 9,000, including Despenser's lordship of Glamorgan ; she also obtained the younger Despenser's movables, plate and jewels.
