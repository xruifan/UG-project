As with the WEA, so in its treatment of adult education as a whole, the Report was cautious, considered, fairly conservative in tone.

Doubts about the military agreement centred on whether the army and the police could work together, given the traditional animosity between the two and pervasive drug-related corruption in both forces as a direct result of low pay. In addition a future crop substitution programme was expected to be seriously hampered by the July 6 murder of Walter Tocas, the leader of the Upper Huallaga Defence Front, a 150,000-strong organization of coca growers in the country's principal coca growing region, by either drug traffickers or Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso)  guerrillas, who were known to work in tandem in the region.

The success of the Dutch in the West Indian sugar trade in the 1640s showed that this natural monopoly of the colonies' trade would not last any longer, so English shipbuilders were gratified to find that the Navigation Act would limit the colonial trade to English ships. The direct effect was to cut sharply into the Dutch carrying trade, by shutting re-exports from Dutch ports out of England (which compensated English colonies to some extent for losing their Dutch connections)  and by forbidding the export of colonial products in Dutch ships. The legislation was resented bitterly enough by the Netherlands to lead to a war in which the English Republic was able to assert itself against the Dutch Republic.

{"TEXT1": "The truth, both for Owen and Marx, is likely to be this : that in the pervasive optimism of the time, it was natural for the revolutionary to suppose that the change to usher in the new order was at hand, whether prompted by an Owenite vision of human perfectibility or by the culminatory movement of the perfecting Marxist dialectical materialism. Since both were wrong, it is of little practical significance that where the one saw the change stealing upon the scene like a thief in the night, the other envisaged the proletariat oppressed beyond further endurance rising in response to the call to the class war to enforce the change. For if, as we have seen, the vacuity at the heart of Owen's prospectus was the tacit assumption that owners, having seen the light, would agreeably acquiesce in the expropriation of their property in order that it would be beneficially used by the workers, that at the heart of Marx's was that the proletariat would as the movement of the dialectic ordained, seize the means of production. In this, as much as in its expectation of the proximity of the event and of the brave new world that the event would introduce, Marx's vision was as millenarian as Owen's. It was as millenarian because there was no tension in the mainspring of the mechanism, in the idea of the alienation of labour. ", "LBL": "i"}

This Eurocentrism was inevitable at a time when in Europe only European history was at all well known, and Marx's and Engels's' general' stages often read like little more than a generalized history of western Europe. Eurocentrism seems however much less excusable in the work of modern historians who, following in Marx's and Engels's footsteps, still seem to consider the examples they used sufficient to generalize about human history (Anderson, 1974) . When these' stages' have been used to identify societies outside Europe the result has often been misleading. For example, Goody and others have argued that the labelling of pre-colonial West African states as' feudal' has obscured the all-important fact that the control of the ruling class did not operate through the control of land, and that therefore Marx's ideas can not be used directly for these societies.

In that case the employees, who were warehousemen employed by a company which supplied nuts and bolts, wrote to ten of their employers' suppliers informing them that they intended to start up in business on their own trading in nuts and bolts, and asking for details of their products. The employers learned of the letters and summarily dismissed the employees for gross misconduct. On their complaints of unfair dismissal an industrial tribunal found that the employers were justified in their decision that the employees were in breach of their implied duty in their contracts of employment that they should be loyal to their employers and that the dismissals were not unfair.

Given the awareness that not all' Asians' were middle class and/or immune to racism within the education system, however, how could the apparently better' Asian'educational performance be understood? In the final analysis, the Swann Report not only put aside what it had already acknowledged about the relatively poor performance of students of Bangladesh I origin, but ignored evidence that students of Mirpuri Pakistani origin were also under performing, while students of East African Asian origin seemed to be achieving exceptionally well. Social class and rural-urban contrasts, and different relations with British colonial states and education systems, are very likely to be involved as causal influences here, and Swann could well have commissioned research to explore some of the underlying issues. Instead, despite its disavowals and qualifications the Report slid into the trap of singling out' Asian' culture and especially its main bearer, ' the Asian family', to explain the contrast with' West Indians'.

It's these lectures which finally unbalance Bob Roberts, which shifts from crisp satire to stodgy tract under the sheer density of Robbins' disgust with US politics, losing along the way the warped rock' n'roll and documentary trappings which give bite to the first film intelligent enough to see assassination as a career move for the victim.

The theme of movement is again explored in the twisting pieces of aluminium, that have been translated into bronze in the final sculpture.

In the meantime an airship had caught fire in the USA, ending the use there of the lethal explosive hydrogen as a lifting gas ; it was replaced by the safer helium. However Germany was short of helium and the major industrial producer — the USA, who was extracting it from natural gas — didn't want to supply it so soon after the war.

It remains the law that a trade union is not, and is not to be treated as if it were, a body corporate, but a much wider measure of tort liability is now imposed by the Employment Act 1982. The central difficulty is that of attributing responsibility to the ‘ centre’ in such a ‘ devolved’organisation as the typical trade union, bearing in mind the likelihood that ‘ unofficial action’will be taken at individual plant level without prior consultation with the union's central organs. The fundamental proposition of the 1982 Act is that the immunity of trade unions in tort is totally abolished, though the union enjoys the same defences as an individual where action is taken in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute. However, the range of the union's responsibility for the acts of its officers and members differs according to the nature of the claim which is brought against it. ", "LBL": "i"}

During the day these organisms absorb carbon dioxide from the water for the process of photosynthesis, the decrease leading to the precipitation of finely divided calcium carbonate by the sea. This deposited material is mainly removed by the waves so that at night, when the algae emit carbon dioxide, the ensuing greater acidity of the sea water causes a chemical attack on the rock itself and not merely the redissolving of the finely divided material precipitated during the day.

So these ideas in Hobbes are an expression of a prevailing wave of thought, a wave which moves on through Gassendi and Locke. Despite the aridities of scholastic philosophy, Hobbes did think that, over the centuries, the seeds of natural reason had borne some fruit. Three notable instances were the geometry of Euclid, the work done on the motion of falling bodies by Galileo, and the discovery of the circulation of the blood by William Harvey. Hobbes's discovery of geometry and his growing sense of the importance of motion in understanding the world were milestones in his intellectual development. ", "LBL": "i"}

Hence, explanations and prescriptions which stress higher investment as the direct means to higher growth in the UK are probably very wide of the mark [ Pollard, 1982 ]. The claim is sometimes made that the capacity of British industry to achieve higher absolute levels of investment has been weakened by declining rates of profit [ Flemming et al.,1976 ]. In addition, low profits might be assumed to have lowered expectations of future profits and hence weakened the incentive to invest — a factor shown by the Radcliffe Report (1959)  to have been far more important in determining investment policy than the rate of interest.

But gradually, as I noted in Chapter One, he came to think that one can not universalise judgements coherently, without this amounting to the development of a universal sympathy with the desires of all affected by one's action. For one has to recognize that if one had their desires one would not accept principles which rode roughshod over their satisfaction, and this implies that one should not accept them at all, since one can not universalise them to that hypothetical situation in which one would be forced to reject them. So one must take into account the effects of one's actions on the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of the desires of all those affected, along the lines of preference utilitarianism.

When a politician assisted a freeholder with a gift of a patronage appointment, he would almost always give it in the guise of an act of friendship, and it was the friendly relationship which was the truly significant factor. The intent of the politician was of course to create a feeling of obligation, which he undoubtedly hoped would stand him in good stead at the next election, but such feelings were all the stronger because the shrewd political manager never breathed a word about a bargain or the anticipated political return. Acts of seemingly disinterested friendship, reinforced by regular social contacts, were in fact the only sound approach to building a powerful county interest. On the other hand, even if the politician demonstrated his ability to provide a great deal of patronage, if he did not follow it up with effective social contact, he would be laying a poor foundation for a political interest, and the gratitude of the freeholders under those circumstances could be short-lived.

There is little doubt, moreover, that in the nuclear age the deterrence mode of thinking has by and large been the intellectually prevalent one. Deterrence has developed a language, a range of scholarship, and a political influence considerably in advance of anything achieved in the name of the laws of war. Moreover, there has sometimes been reason to doubt the relevance of laws-of-war thinking to the important objective of strategic stability in relations between the nuclear powers. ", "LBL": "i"}

To understand why this is so we need to return to the polytrauma theory outlined earlier and see what its significance is for the development of the modern individual. It was argued earlier that man, a creature with unprepossessing qualities for higher social development, became capable of that development because of traumatic social changes which occurred in the past but whose impact was so immense that they have shaped human nature down to the present and have been the determining influences on the evolution of culture, whose function, by and large, is the transmission of the consequences of these primal, traumatic experiences to subsequent generations in the form of ego, and, most especially, superego, development. We saw that the first, and most important, of these traumatic social changes was the transition from vegetarian foraging to big-game hunting which precipitated the murder of the primal father, and that subsequent totemic culture, still extant until recently in some parts of the world, was a consequence of this. We saw that initiation ceremonies and totemic ceremonial in general were means of instilling in fresh generations the consequences of the traumatic experiences of their predecessors. ", "LBL": "i"}

In 1889 a Select Committee heard another plea from a male trade unionist for the restriction of married women's work on the grounds that ‘ when the married women turn into the domestic workshops they become competitors against their own husbands and it requires a man and his wife to earn what the man alone would earn if she were not in the shop’. He added for good measure : ‘ During the time she is in the shop her domestic duties are being neglected’. During the inter-war period what trade union support there was for family allowances (generally it was feared that allowances would lead to a wholesale reduction in wages and reduce the bargaining power of male workers) , was based on the hope that they would lead to a withdrawal of married women from the workforce. However, there may well have been other pressures on working class men as individuals, causing them to oppose the work of their wives. ", "LBL": "i"}

If the CEO or the manager of the group is held accountable for outcomes, then in the final analysis, he or she will have to agree with group decisions or have the authority to block them, which means that the group never really had decision-making power to begin with. Alternatively, if groups are allowed to make decisions without their manager's seal of approval, then accountability as such will suffer, for if a group does badly, the group is never fired (and it would be shocking if it were) .

The entitlements that animals assuredly have, embodied in prolific legislation, are those that human beings have given them. ", "LBL": "l"}

Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long. This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well. ", "LBL": "l"}

British governments had no strength to resist these arguments, and as a consequence the North Sea Oil installations, working literally at break-neck speed unfettered by safety regulations comparable to those operating on-shore, had a fatality rate eleven times greater than the construction industry, nine times higher than mining, and six times greater than quarrying. Carson concludes, after carefully researching the individual incidents which constituted this high rate of fatality (as well as those involving serious injuries)  that the majority could have been avoided if the ‘ political economy of speed’ had not been allowed to supersede the ‘ political economy of employees lives and limbs’. With the internationalization of capital and the concentration of power in the hands of fewer and fewer transnational corporations, national law violation may well become old fashioned.

But more important were Southey's fundamental doubts concerning the likely success of Pantisocracy in any form. Coleridge remembered with bewilderment the occasions of some more memorable disagreements on the subject : during a strawberry party at Long Ashton ; crossing the bridge below Bristol High Street after visiting the Fricker family ; on a two-day excursion to Chepstow and Tintern with Joseph Cottle, Edith and Sara, during which, with poetical appropriateness, they all got lost in pitch darkness above Tintern Abbey and Southey ‘ marched on like a pillar of strength, with a lady pressing on each arm’. The final breach grew from Southey's good fortune in being offered an annuity of £ 160 during the summer of 1795. Thereupon Southey announced that, Pantisocrat or no, his private resources were his own, and that on the Welsh farm each person should manage his own affairs. ", "LBL": "l"}

Though Hitchcock himself toured the locations in Denmark, East Germany and Sweden, he settled for filming at the Universal lot in the San Fernando valley. Some exteriors were subcontracted to a German crew, presumably within the nationalized, party-controlled and uncreative East German film industry, mainly for economy — the stars had been too expensive and corners were cut elsewhere. Hitchcock regretted the decision when he found that the plates for the extended sequence involving two buses travelling between Leipzig and East Berlin were unsatisfactory. The' false' bus, used for escaping refugees, is carrying Michael (Paul Newman)  and Sarah (Julie Andrews) , American scientists on the run from the security police, to the comparative safety of East Berlin ; it has to keep a few minutes ahead of the real, scheduled bus, so in fact most of the shots out of the bus windows concentrate mainly on the distance between the two buses, gradually diminishing and so raising suspicion.

THE source material of A Private Life, one of the first theatrical projects funded by the BBC, derives to all intents and purposes from a five-minute segment in an award-winning BBC series from 1978 called The White Tribe Of Africa. This disturbing profile of Afrikaners in their own backyard was drawn by David Dimbleby and directed by London-born but South Africa-educated Francis Gerard who, more than a decade later, makes his feature debut with A Private Life.

From this industrious factory, and from others across London, came a never-ending flow of costume melodramas, musicals, detective stories and films in every other sort of genre.

Mutations in the D-stem and/or the variable loop in tRNA Asp caused drastically decreased levels of m 1 G37, Q34, manQ34 and Ψ40 in the anticodon loop / stem, while the m 2 2G6 formation was unaffected and the rate of m 5 C49-formation was enhanced.

Let us for the time being not take a stand on this issue but address ourselves to the whole phenomenon in its strong sense. Whether a system with finitely many basic signals is a system of communication in the strong sense — that is, a linguistic system — depends on whether the characteristic behaviour within which and against which it is interpreted is complex enough to sustain attributions of higher-order beliefs and intentions to the creatures concerned. If one has to resort to such an intentional framework in order to make sense of the behaviour, in order to explain what the creatures are doing and why, and has so to resort after exhausting all possibilities of more austere, less anthropomorphic frameworks of explanation, then one is on the route to linguistic meanings.

Jones's book remained untouched on the shelves of Northumbria's modest library in its first two years, even though it had good reviews ; and the influence of his research has been all but negligible. For even though some attempt to give status to the ‘ community or home beat officer’ has been made following Lord Scarman's (1981)  report on the Brixton riots which gave something of a ‘ slap on the wrist’to the service, the deference accorded to specialist posting or to detective work remains untouched. In effect Jones's book revealed an unwelcome truth which no one really wanted to hear and which the service was able easily to diffuse and ignore. Indeed when I was at the police college in 1987 and Jones was on the Senior Command Course prior to taking up a position as assistant chief constable, I took a straw poll among my immediate colleagues to see what influence such books achieve.

The Labour leaders refused to join a reconstituted War Cabinet under Neville Chamberlain's premiership, for party divisions were still acute : but, with the Liberals, Labour accepted an electoral truce whereby the main parties undertook to refrain from opposing the candidate of any retiring member's party at by-elections occasioned during the war. This in no way limited the cut-and-thrust of political disagreement. In the winter of 1939–40 pacifist feeling was still strong inside the Labour Party, and it was reinforced by the anti-war attitude of the Communists and' crypto-Communists', the latter being Labour Party members who, whether under Communist Party instructions or not, consistently supported Communist policies without openly joining the Communist Party. When Soviet troops invaded Finland in November 1939, for instance, there was widespread sympathy in Britain for the latest victims of aggression ; but D. N.

Second, the results proved something we had already begun to suspect, that there are important functional differences between left and right sides of the chick brain. There was a lot of evidence accumulating at the time about lateralization of function in bird brains — for instance, it appears that chicks respond behaviourally in different ways when they view things with left and right eyes, while in song birds like canaries and zebra finches, the ‘ song centre’ is located in a left-hemisphere region, rather close to our IMHV. What these differences between the two halves of the brain might be telling us, we had no idea at the time — but some clues will begin to appear by the end of the next chapter. Third, and of more practical importance, we now knew where to look for any further changes ; by being able to concentrate on IMHV and LPO and discard ‘ irrelevant’ tissue we might hope to magnify any effect we were studying by diminishing background noise.

It has been held that the term relates to being under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and the offence is not capable of commission where the intoxication is induced by a substance other than alcohol, such as a solvent. Disorderly conduct bears the same significance as it does in the section 5 offence, and is likely to involve conduct such as shouting or singing in such a way as to alarm persons near by, uncertainty of gait, staggering, lurching or swaying, and behaviour that causes people to take evasive action.

The new evidence contradicted Bush's claims that he was \" out of the loop \" of those who approved the Iran-contra operation and that, when he did discover the arms deal, he was unaware of its quid pro quo element in regard to the hostages. Clinton used the revelation to accuse Bush of having lied to the public and, thereby, of having diminished the credibility of the presidency.

It was noticeable that the libraries who listed a substantial number of local authority courses were often the ones who listed substantial numbers of internal and external courses as well, so that there was a strong relationship between total number of courses and involvement of local authority (see Table 24) . Furthermore, commitment of such central training resources to libraries often went hand-in-hand with commitment of library management time to training, presumably because to an extent both are aspects of the same overall policy of the parent authority towards training. This overall policy can be crucial : the following comment was made by a library whose training officer post on the library establishment was frozen, in response to being asked how they would like to develop their overall programme, if adequate resources were available : ‘ Commitment of our authority to a training policy : adequate resources will not, without such a policy, solve the problem’.

As the champion of the unskilled workers of Ireland, patriot and prophet of revolutionary socialism, Larkin claimed both independence of and support from all and sundry in the trade union world. In March 1913, profiting from Wilson's 1911 victory, Larking embarked on a fifteen week dispute with the City of Dublin Steamship Packet Company, bringing this to a successful conclusion and becoming in his biographer's words, \" the virtual dictator of the port of Dublin \", and the possessor of a profitable joint agreement with the shipowners arrived at on 26 May which included a no-strike clause.

One of the most important tasks in analysing intonation is to listen to the speaker's pitch and recognise what it is doing ; this is not an easy thing to do, and it seems to be a quite different skill from that acquired in studying segmental phonetics. We describe pitch in terms of high and low, and some people find it difficult to relate what they hear in someone's voice to a scale ranging from low to high. We should remember that ‘ high’ and ‘ low’are arbitrary choices for end-points of the pitch scale. It would be perfectly reasonable to think of pitch as ranging instead from ‘ light’ to ‘ heavy’, for example, or from ‘ left’to ‘ right’, and people who have difficulty in ‘ hearing’intonation patterns are generally only having difficulty in relating what they hear (which is the same as what everyone else hears)  to this ‘ pseudo-spatial’representation.

Shleifer ’s research looks at 75 countries and asks how many formal steps it takes to establish (legally and without bribes)  a new company, how long it takes to do so, and what is the cost. For if a country makes it hard to create companies, do n’t be surprised if new companies are few and far between. And if companies are not created, where will growth and employment come from? The table (see at the bottom of the text)  gives a flavor of the odyssey involved in setting up a business : an average for 75 countries shows more than 10 separate steps of getting various certificates and a cumulative time of 63 days spent in getting the paperwork done (assuming no bureaucratic delays)  and total payments to government as high as one third of a year ’s income.

He would not, of course, be alone in being exposed in the General Prologue and enhancing the adverse view of himself by his own Prologue — consider, for instance, the Pardoner — but he would be alone in then telling a tale which clinches the destruction of any claim to a good character he might have ; a tale without any redeeming features, which the tales of even the worst of the corrupt clerics, the Friar and the Pardoner, have. After reminding ourselves, once more, that the General Prologue portrait of the Reeve contains its ambiguities — possibly sinister ones — we can start our examination of the portrayal of the Reeve with his Prologue.

M Beregovoy may claim that he has nothing to reproach himself with, but his acceptance of an interest-free million franc (£ 125,000)  loan from a shady businessman looks suspicious to say the least. M Beregovoy says that he accepted the money from his ‘ friend,’ Roger-Patrice Pelat, in September 1986 in order to help buy a modest, 100 sq m flat for himself in the fashionable 16th Arrondissement of Paris, costing 2.5 million francs.

Six years of intense agitation followed, until Leopold's death finally opened the way for reforms in the Belgian Congo, and the opening of the colony to free trade. Throughout this agitation Morel's appeal to the presumed interests of Liverpool merchants was quite open and unashamed : the liberation of Africans enslaved by Leopold and his monopolistic ring of financiers, and the interests of genuine traders in free trade, went hand in hand.

There was of course no sudden switch to solos and duets with continuo or other independent instrumental accompaniment, yet by the mid-century the old forms of madrigal, polyphonic chanson, and Lied were obsolescent. As the Roman polymath Pietro della Valle observed in 1640 madrigals were now not often sung, ‘ nor is there occasion to sing them, since people prefer to hear singing freely by heart with instruments in the hand rather than to watch four or five companions singing with book in hand at a table like schoolboys (che ha troppo del scolaresco e dello studio) ’. However as late as 1668 another Roman, Mario Savioni (c. 1608–1685)  brought out a book of five-part Madrigali morali e spirituali, explaining that they were to be sung each at the end of one of his previously published Concerti morali and adding that he had ‘ taken care to unite together the aria and the madrigal so as to conform with the character of the concertos’.

From a national movement designed to revolutionize the political structure of the nation, the BUF had degenerated into an organization which became increasingly dependent on a localized campaign playing on anti-immigrant racial populist themes, which was to be the main pattern of British fascism from then onwards. National campaigns, like the support for Edward VIII during the abdication crisis of 1936, and the portrayal of the BUF as a peace movement in the later 1930s, either fell on deaf ears or were only partially successful in changing the focus of fascist politics from the parish pump and the anti-immigrant concerns of the East End of London to wider issues.

Network theorists are interested in questions like which individuals conform most closely to group norms, who innovates and who resists innovation, and how changing social conditions at the local level — rehousing or factory closures for example— affect the group's linguistic habits. This focus on the micro level of social or community structure discourages stereotypical generalisations. I do think, however, that Jenkins and Kramarae are still right about the treatment of women. There is in sociolinguistics an implicit assumption that where women's speech differs from men's, it is the behaviour of the women rather than the men that requires explanation ; men are the norm from which women deviate.

The latter is particularly appropriate to the railways with their highly bureaucratic, rule-bound organization and their emphasis on safety embodied in complex systems of regulations such as the ‘ Rules for the Observance of Employees’ in BR or the ‘ Reglamento de Seguridad en la Circulación’(Safety Regulations for Railway Traffic)  in RENFE.

By giving more or less free rein to the more extreme parts of the opposition, he encourages talk of Taiwan's independence. Eleven members of the Democratic Progressive party elected to the National Assembly have been barred from taking their seats because they will not take an oath of loyalty to the Republic of China (the official name for Taiwan) , only to the Republic of Taiwan. Independence may be a reality in fact if not in name, but it contradicts the dream of a united China that both the Kuomintang and the communists of Beijing hold dear — so dear that China has always threatened to use force if Taiwan declared independence.

The railway engineer, therefore, provides a transition curve to ease the engine from one radius to another while adjusting the superelevation, or ca nt, to counter the centrifugal force. The length of the transition curve depends upon the total change of radius, the velocity of the engine and the permitted superelevation, bearing in mind that the ca nt must not be so great that if an engine is halted it will topple over.

But the position from which he is today assessed rests on precarious, even quaint, over-simplifications. According to popular tradition, Constantine had always been tolerant, if not sympathetic, towards Christianity — an intrinsically ‘ good man’, even before he ‘ saw the light’ definitively. In fact, Constantine's attitude towards Christianity seems to have been primarily a matter of expediency, for Christians by then were numerous in the Empire and he needed all the support he could muster against Maxentius, his rival for the imperial throne. In A.D. 312, Maxentius was killed and his army routed at the Battle of Milvian Bridge, leaving Constantine's claim to the throne unchallenged. ", "LBL": "i"}

Racial and cultural difference are addressed in this context both as determinants in the production of meanings and as a means of putting the concerns of White Western feminist film criticism into perspective. These concerns must be recognised as specific, which doesn't mean that semiotics or Lacanian film theory has no relevance outside the established framework of Anglo-American and European cinema, but rather that their legitimacy should not automatically be assumed or their dominance remain uncontested in the light of developments within feminism at large. For example, Brunsdon notes that' Hollywood, as the world-dominant cinema, exports ideals of White femininity worldwide', yet feminist critics have rarely looked at this aspect of the Hollywood dream-machine in their copious critiques of it. (Brunsdon 1986, p. 55)  In relation to the production of more differentiated cultural meanings, Jacqueline Bobo's article in Female Spectators (1988)  on Black women's viewing of Spielberg's The Color Purple offers a good example of where feminist film criticism might go next.

The population growth study took into account both accessibility and the impact of planning policies, including constraints such as green belts. The GIS gave rapid and easy access to the data in a number of different ways, it provided analytical tools for the production of statistical tables, and it allowed the output of maps and specific factors, such as the overlay of the road network onto the green belt layer, showing areas of high and low accessibility, thus permitting the evaluation of population growth potential relative to accessibility and planning constraints. The second study used the transport layer of the database to identify the locations of 900 stations on the British Railways network.

In practice, however, the sovereignty of Parliament has increasingly become the sovereignty of the Commons, and the sovereignty of the Commons has increasingly become the sovereignty of the government and the majority party. More than this, many constitutional authorities have become uneasy about the behaviour of governments in the light of the doctrines of mandate and the manifesto which are said to give effective power to party activists and extremists outside of parliament. In hard reality, therefore, many authorities consider that the sovereignty of parliament really means the sovereignty of an unrepresentative party boss who is then given a free constitutional rein to wreak unlimited havoc. Constitutional authorities are critical of the established constitution precisely because it has somehow allowed, and not limited, the emergence of the pattern of party politics and state intervention which they regard as so disastrous for Britain and her economy.

The person beset by fears and anxieties who nevertheless manages to present a confident exterior will often feel self-contempt because he feels that he is living a lie and that one day someone will catch him out.

A nose hook provides more stability for aerotowing, and it is a slight advantage to start the take-off a little on the upwind side of the towplane. This ensures that there is a sideways pull on the nose, helping to prevent both the glider and the towplane from weathercocking into wind.

The objection therefore to totalization is not founded on any simple analogy with totalitarianism — though neither can this be excluded — but rather on the implicit violence of ontology itself, in which the same constitutes itself through a form of negativity in relation to the other, producing all knowledge by appropriating and sublating the other within itself. As Levinas puts it, ‘ the idea of truth as a grasp on things must necessarily have a non-metaphorical sense somewhere’. ", "LBL": "i"}

It has further been shown that the hemispherical reflectance of an individual leaf is insufficient to describe the remotely-sensed bidirectional reflectance (defined below)  of a vegetation canopy (, , ) . However simple grass canopies with a high LAI have reflectance properties similar to those of a single leaf, which means a positive relationship between near infra-red bidirectional reflectance and LAI, but a negative relationship in the red region.

In fact, most species of frogs and toads that lay their eggs in areas exposed to direct sunlight produce black eggs, whereas those species whose eggs develop in concealed places usually lay white eggs.

This case dealt with a life interest in possession overseas trust which was presumed to be governed by a trust law similar to that in the United Kingdom (otherwise the decision would have been different (see Garland v Archer-Shee (1931)  15 TC 693) ) . The House of Lords held that when determining the nature of the source of the income arising to the trust one looked through the trust treating the trust for all practical purposes as if it did not exist.

In September Croatia followed suit. At the heart of the dispute were two diametrically opposed views of a future Yugoslav state : the republics of Slovenia and Croatia wanted a loose association of sovereign states on a confederate model, while Serbia, backed by Montenegro, favoured a strong centralist system in which Serbia would dominate the political and economic agenda. Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia favoured a third option ; a \" community \" of republics with a federal police force and army, a single currency and full monetary union, but with each member of the community also retaining its own army, and holding an equitable proportion of the federal offices and services.
