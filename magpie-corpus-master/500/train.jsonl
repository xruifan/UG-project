That's right, Bolton won five nil but what we did get clarified from the Football League today was if two English teams finish their four games on the same number of points, is it goal difference or is it the number of goals scored that is the crucial factor? And rather surprisingly, bearing in mind what happens in the Endsleigh first division, that there it is goals scored that dis differentiates between teams, in this league it will be goal difference that will determine the final positions, followed then by the highest number of goals and then by the highest number of goals scored away from home. So at the moment Notts County, although they scored four goals and Bolton scored five, so in the current English system they'd just be one goal behind Bolton, their goal difference is only plus two, Bolton's is plus five, so that is a significant factor.

The ratchet is invariably geared to the rate of return which the investors expect to receive on their equity and that usually depends on the expected market capitalisation of the company. When acting for management, it is important to ensure that the ratchet is not entirely geared to the vagaries of the stock market in the event of a flotation, but also reflects the profitability of the company.

So these ideas in Hobbes are an expression of a prevailing wave of thought, a wave which moves on through Gassendi and Locke. Despite the aridities of scholastic philosophy, Hobbes did think that, over the centuries, the seeds of natural reason had borne some fruit. Three notable instances were the geometry of Euclid, the work done on the motion of falling bodies by Galileo, and the discovery of the circulation of the blood by William Harvey. Hobbes's discovery of geometry and his growing sense of the importance of motion in understanding the world were milestones in his intellectual development. ", "LBL": "i"}

Indeed, the author of Le débat des hérauts d'armes could state that the French nobility did not regard fighting at sea as being a noble activity : it is perhaps for this reason that naval warfare did not feature in the chronicles in the way that war on land did. Nor did it seem apparent to all that the war fought at sea, the damage which might be inflicted upon enemy vessels and morale, and the consequences which victory at sea could have for those who lived in areas close to coasts, were all part of a wider war which could not be restricted to the fighting on land. So it was that when the Hundred Years War began, although both the French and the English kingdoms had particular naval objectives which they needed to further for military reasons, neither could be said to have possessed a proper navy.

Its corollary, or ‘ visage’, is the concept of totality, which, as Levinas observes, has dominated Western philosophy in its long history of desire for Unity and the One. Through the totality, itself a kind of rational self writ large, the individual takes on meaning ; the present is sacrificed to a future which will bring forth an ultimate, objective meaning when the totality of history is realized. The objection therefore to totalization is not founded on any simple analogy with totalitarianism — though neither can this be excluded — but rather on the implicit violence of ontology itself, in which the same constitutes itself through a form of negativity in relation to the other, producing all knowledge by appropriating and sublating the other within itself.

The Portuguese capital market is currently in a state of apathy and relatively stagnant, so the bank has decided to enlarge and diversify the shareholding,’ says BCP's chairman Jorge Jardin Goncalves. The international share sale is the latest in a series of foreign initiatives by Portugal's fastest growing bank, which was started from scratch by a group of industrialists in 1985 and now ranks fourth in terms of assets in a country notorious for its profusion of banks. Faced with a rush of competition from foreign banks when Portugal is forced to remove remaining barriers to entry after next year, banks such as BCP have been expanding fast in an attempt to ensure their market share of domestic business in banking and other financial services. BCP has established links with Friends Provident in Britain and has an insurance joint venture in Portgual with Cariplo, an Italian bank. ", "LBL": "i"}

By this time, some are up to 14″ — but because the original outlay on stock didn't break the bank, Ken can offer them remarkably reasonably-priced. Many Koi bought by BKKS customers from London and Norwich have won prizes at shows, and the varieties include the ‘ Big Three’ plus metallics, Gin-rin and Kawarimono. Quite apart from the cost factor, this growing-on of fish means that all the Japanese Koi have overcome the teething problems you associate with new imports. ", "LBL": "i"}

However, editorial priorities are inevitably slanted against the exposure of new acts. When it comes to profiles and interviews, familiar names usually get the nod over the up-and-coming, partly because they are the ones the powers-that-be have heard of, and partly because the famous and/or notorious are what a less obsessive and more catholic readership wants to know about.
