And the reason for the importance of this ch ch channel is that it opens when axons depolarize. So when th axons depolarize, under the influence of the opening of sodium channels, the opening of the deray delayed rectifier then leads to a repolarizing phase which occurs precisely because the equilibrium potential for potassium is held relatively negative. So that's just summarized on this diagram here, which is shown er for a squid axon, and I've plotted here the equilibrium potential for sodium, which is relatively positive, here at mi at plus fifty millivolts, and the equilibrium potential for potassium which is held relatively negative. And at this point the axon is stimulated, a depolarization occurs which is associated with the opening of sodium channels, which then close.

However, reversal from left to right visual field superiority was observed by Kaufer, Morais and Bertelson (1975)  when they investigated the effect of presenting a Landolt's ring at fixation for subjects to report the position of a small gap in the ring prior to recalling the stimuli presented in the left and right visual fields. It is therefore possible that in some circumstances a stimulus at fixation serves as an anchor such that processing occurs first for material appearing to the right of fixation. Moreover, it has been suggested on the basis of experiments carried out with children that the nature of a fixation stimulus may affect visual hemifield asymmetry by inducing a bias towards either verbal or non-verbal processing, depending on the nature of the stimulus (Kershner, Thomae and Callaway, 1977 ; Carter and Kinsbourne, 1979) .
